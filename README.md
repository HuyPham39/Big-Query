# üõçÔ∏è E-Commerce Funnel Analysis with BigQuery & Plotly

This project analyzes user behavior and conversion rates across the e-commerce sales funnel using the public thelook_ecommerce dataset hosted on Google BigQuery.

## Key Insights

- Funnel drop-offs are most significant between browsing and cart addition stages.
- Some traffic sources convert significantly better than others.
- Seasonality patterns weren't identifiable in traffic and conversion rates.

## Tools & Skills Applied

- **SQL** (Google BigQuery) ‚Äî for extracting session-level data and aggregating funnel metrics.
- **Pandas** ‚Äî for data wrangling, timestamp manipulation, and intermediate transformations.
- **Plotly** ‚Äî for dynamic and clear funnel visualizations and time-series trend plots.
- **Conversion Funnel Analysis** ‚Äî identifying performance drop-offs and potential optimizations.
